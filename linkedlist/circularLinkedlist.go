/**

Definition: Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.

Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
- Any node can be a starting point. We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point. We just need to stop when the first visited node is visited again.
- Useful for implementation of queue. We donâ€™t need to maintain two pointers for front and rear if we use circular linked list. We can maintain a pointer to the last inserted node and front can always be obtained as next of last.
- Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list. For example, when multiple applications are running on a PC, it is common for the operating system to put the running applications on a list and then to cycle through them, giving each of them a slice of time to execute, and then making them wait while the CPU is given to another application. It is convenient for the operating system to use a circular list so that when it reaches the end of the list it can cycle around to the front of the list.
- 4) Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.
